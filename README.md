# tfl-network

Plots and part of the storyline for the presentation of the doctoral thesis "Nonparametric Bayesian label prediction on a graph" that is comprehensible to non-specialists. Contains an analysis of simulated station traffic data on the Transport for London network (tube, overground, DLR, tramlink). The edges in the network are actual line connections and stations that are within walking distance as per the [TfL network](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/large-print-tube-map.pdf) (May 2019). 

* The data folder contains the edge list of the network and station coordinates and zones in a .csv file. The Lines.xlsx file contains the edge list in .xlsx format with a separate sheet per line.
* The Jupyter notebook contains the storyline, plots and example analysis.
