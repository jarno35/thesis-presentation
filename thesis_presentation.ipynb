    "# Nonparametric Bayesian label prediction on a graph\n",
    "\n",
    "This script generates the plots and parts of the storyline for the presentation of the doctoral thesis \"Nonparametric Bayesian label prediction on a graph\" that is comprehensible to non-specialists. It includes an analysis of simulated station traffic data on the Transport for London network (tube, overground, DLR, tramlink). The edges in the network are actual line connections and stations that are within walking distance as per the [TfL network](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/large-print-tube-map.pdf) (May 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data folder contains the edge list of the network and station coordinates and zones in .csv format. The Lines.xlsx file contains the edge list with a separate sheet per line, it is not used in our script, but included for readability.\n",
    "* The modules folder contains thesis_presentation_aux.py which is a module with auxilliary functions used in this notebook.\n",
    "* This notebook contains the storyline, plots and example analysis of the TfL network."

Some stations are busy (red) and other stations are quiet (green). For half of the stations we have no information (light grey). Additionally, the information we have might have measurement errors. "

The underlying assumption of these methods is that stations that are close to each other in the network should be about equally busy."
